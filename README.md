# nvim
Custom configuration based on [Lazyvim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) starter template.  It's been a fun to trying to configure neovim according to my own preference. However, it's a pain to keepup with new configuration. Therefore, alleviating the pain with lazyvim, and just enjoy the wonderful experience with neovimÔºÅ
